This program demo runs on both Windows and Mac platforms. 

About: 
This application is being written for the UNC Biology Department to assist with research into the migration patterns of sea turtles.  Arena Tracker 2.0 (in combination with custom hardware equipment) will allow the user to run trials on swimming sea turtles, measuring the angle at which they are swimming and exporting this data in a .txt file.  

This is currently a demo version; all angle information is randomly generated by the computer.  Integration with US Digital USB 4.0 Data Acquisition USB Device is in progress (http://www.usdigital.com/products/interfaces/pc/usb/usb4).  This integration will limit the program to use on a Windows platform, but will allow the Biology Department to use custom hardware to measure the turtlesâ€™ swimming patterns.  

See the issues section for known bugs.
