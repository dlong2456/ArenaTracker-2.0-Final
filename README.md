About: 
This application was written for the UNC Biology Department to assist with research into the migration patterns of sea turtles.  Arena Tracker 2.0 (in combination with custom hardware equipment) allows the user to run trials on swimming sea turtles (or other swimming animals, such as lobsters), measuring the angle at which they are swimming and exporting this data in a .txt file. The hardware equipment required to run ArenaTracker is the US Digital USB 4.0 Data Acquisition USB Device (http://www.usdigital.com/products/interfaces/pc/usb/usb4).
